desc: (UX) Writer & Data Science.
about: I love literature. I'm a creative writer with a Bachelor's degree in Social Communication and technical education in data science. Currently finishing a Master's Degree in Creative Writing at Seville University, Spain. For my thesis I'm investigating (reading papers about) the relationship between AI and Literature by analizing how story generator algorithms write fiction "by themselves" in non-advertising ways. I code in Python, RASA library, to articulate an essay as a chatbot. Current mindframe: B. Latour, D. Haraway, R. Barthes, R. Piglia and W. Benjamin.
