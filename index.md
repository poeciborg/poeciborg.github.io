Hi! I'm Matías.

This a simple testimony of my existence on [GitHub](https://poeciborg.github.io/).

### I write, code, design, research. Mostly, I love to learn.

I'm a writer with a Bachelor's degree in Social Communication and a Master's degree in Creative Writing. Also, I'm equipped with diverse technical skills, a wide range including: desing, python, some HTML, machine learning and data science.

Currently, I'm deeply interested in the relationship between AI, Literature and society. I've recently analized papers about story generator algorithms to understand how they write fiction "by themselves".

### Current mindframe

- Bruno Latour
- Donna Haraway
- Roland Barthes
